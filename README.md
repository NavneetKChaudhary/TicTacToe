## TicTacToe
#### This Game is for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
#### If every player plays optimally then it ends being tie. 
#### In this program we have used minimax algorithm to find the optimal move by the computer. This algrithm gives the optimal move at every stage of the game and thus computer ends up with the win or tie, eventually making it unbeatable.
## What is minimax Algorithm ?
#### Minimax is a recursive algorithm which is used to choose an optimal move for a player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. As its name suggests, its goal is to minimize the maximum loss (minimize the worst case scenario).

#### This is the idea behind the selection of optimal choice from AI.
